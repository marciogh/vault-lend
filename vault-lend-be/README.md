### API input and validation

As  this is a trivial implementation bit, I decided to delay it. The backend is not capturing the input and not performing any logic.

### Service logic

Same as above.

### Jest tests

Same as above.

### CORS configuration

CORS (and be URL) is hardcoded.

### Security / Rate Limiting / CI-CD

All of these are completely negleted for the moment.
